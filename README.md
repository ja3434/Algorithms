# Algorithms
just a bunch of algorithms to work with


BIGINT_DEC - class for unusually big integers || operators: '+' , '-' => O(n) ; '\*' , '/' , '%' =>  O(n^2) ; pow => O(n^2 log k) ;

Centroid_Decomposition - struct for making tree of centroids and calculating every node centroid level || O(nlogn);

Convex_hull - Graham's algorithm + find if point is inside hull (binary search) || Graham => O(n) + O(n log n)(angle sort) ; find => O(log n) ;

Interval_tree - tree for adding on interval and counting sum on interval || O(log n) ; TREE for: sum,max,min || O(log n)

Ext_Euclid - Extended Euclidean Algorithm for finding modular multiplicative inverse || O(log n)
